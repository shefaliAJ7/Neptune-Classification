"This report covers a 2-week, baseline inspection of problem identification and resolution (Inspection Procedures 71152 and 71004).",29,225,355,ML11244A041.txt,U
This inspection was conducted by three regional inspectors and the Point Beach resident inspector.,29,355,453,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Based on the results of this inspection, there were no findings or violations identified during this inspection.",29,453,565,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Identification and Resolution of Problems The inspection generally concluded that implementation of the corrective action program (CAP) was adequate to identify, evaluate, and correct issues.",29,565,756,ML11244A041.txt,U
A sufficiently low threshold for identifying issues and entering them in the CAP existed.,29,756,845,ML11244A041.txt,U
The plant's safety culture is generally healthy and workers at the site expressed willingness to raise safety concerns.,29,845,964,ML11244A041.txt,U
Operating experience was entered into the CAP and appropriately evaluated.,29,964,1038,ML11244A041.txt,U
Self-assessments are being conducted at appropriate frequencies for all departments and resulting deficiencies and enhancements included in the CAP.,29,1038,1186,ML11244A041.txt,U
Quality assurance (Nuclear Oversight (NOS)) oversight of the CAP and work performance was considered good.,29,1186,1292,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspection did identify weaknesses in the plant programs for trending long-standing and repetitious issues.,29,1292,1403,ML11244A041.txt,O
Adverse trends in reject rates for Apparent Cause Evaluations and with equipment problems associated with radiation monitors and services water valves were not identified by the respective trend programs.,29,1403,1607,ML11244A041.txt,O
Additional deficiencies were identified with the conduct and quality of operability determinations and reportability evaluations.,29,1607,1736,ML11244A041.txt,O
"Similar issues had been previously identified by NRC resident staff and NOS and represented a weakness of the CAP to improve this area and CAP oversight groups, such as the Issue Screening Team (IST) and the Management Review Committee (MRC), to monitor and enforce adequate standards.",29,1736,2021,ML11244A041.txt,O

.1 a.,37,230,235,ML11244A041.txt,U
Assessment of the Corrective Action Program (CAP) Effectiveness Inspection Scope The inspectors reviewed the licensee's CAP implementing procedures and attended selected CAP program meetings to assess the implementation of the CAP by site personnel.,37,235,484,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors reviewed risk and safety-significant issues in the licensee's CAP since the last NRC PI&R inspection in April 2009.,37,484,614,ML11244A041.txt,U
The items selected ensured an adequate review of issues across the NRC cornerstones.,37,614,698,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors used issues identified through NRC generic communications, department self-assessments, licensee audits, operating experience reports, and NRC-documented findings as sources to select issues.",37,698,904,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Additionally, the inspectors reviewed CAP items generated that had resulted from performance of daily plant activities.",37,904,1023,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors also reviewed CAP items and a selection of completed investigations from the licensee's various investigation methods, including root, apparent, and common cause evaluations.",37,1023,1212,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors performed a more extensive review of the safety-related component cooling water (CCW) system.,37,1212,1320,ML11244A041.txt,U
This review consisted of a five-year search of related issues identified in the CAP and discussions with appropriate licensee staff to assess the licensee's efforts in addressing identified concerns.,37,1320,1519,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors reviewed licensee's CAP and work management system procedures that provided guidance for trending.,37,1519,1632,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors selected the radiation monitoring and the service water systems as vertical slice samples based on input from the resident staff semi-annual trend review.,37,1632,1801,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors reviewed corrective action documents for the past two years, interviewed the system engineers, and performed a walk-down of these systems.",37,1801,1954,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors reviewed issues related to the extended power uprate (EPU) project, since this involved large, construction-oriented organizations (such as Bechtel) performing significant modifications to the plant over the last several years.",37,1954,2196,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Specifically, Bechtel's use of the licensee's CAP was reviewed.",37,2196,2259,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors attended meetings of the Issue Screening Team (IST) and Management Review Committee (MRC) to observe how issues were being screened and evaluated and to obtain insights into the licensee's oversight of the CAP program.,37,2259,2492,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors reviewed the timeliness and effectiveness of corrective actions for selected issue reports, completed investigations, and NRC findings, including non-cited violations (NCVs).",37,2492,2681,ML11244A041.txt,U

"During the reviews, the inspectors evaluated whether the licensee's actions were in compliance with the facility's CAP and with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B requirements.",43,0,169,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Specifically, the inspectors evaluated if licensee personnel were identifying plant issues at the proper threshold, entering the issues into the CAP in a timely manner, and assigning the appropriate prioritization for resolution of the issues.",43,169,412,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors also assessed whether the licensee staff assigned the appropriate investigation method to ensure the proper determination of root, apparent, and contributing causes.",43,412,592,ML11244A041.txt,U

"(1) Assessment Effectiveness of Problem Identification Issues were generally being identified at a low threshold, evaluated appropriately, and corrected in the CAP.",43,594,758,ML11244A041.txt,U
Workers were familiar with the CAP and felt comfortable raising concerns.,43,758,831,ML11244A041.txt,U
A large number of CAP items were generated annually; which were reasonably distributed across the various departments.,43,831,949,ML11244A041.txt,U
A relatively new computer program was instituted that personnel interviewed described as easier to enter issues and also did automatic generation of a CAP issue when completing a work request.,43,949,1141,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Although, it was also noted the system no longer had the capability to specifically identify which issues were initiated due to NRC concerns.",43,1141,1282,ML11244A041.txt,U
"In 2009, a NOS (Nuclear Oversight--quality assurance) surveillance, PBN 10-003, ""2009 4th Quarter Site Quarter Priority DQS Roll-up,"" (PBNP-QA-10-01), was conducted of the Bechtel CAP and concluded the Bechtel QA [Quality Assurance] Program for the EPU project during the Unit 2 refueling outage 30 was inadequate and did not prevent significant performance deficiencies from occurring and recurring.",43,1282,1682,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Resulting corrective actions included training, lowering the threshold for Bechtel personnel entering issues into the CAP, encouraging personnel to enter issues into CAP, thorough and timely resolution of CAP issues, and the use of the Point Beach CAP for all issues or events related to equipment problems within the scope of the Bechtel contract.",43,1682,2030,ML11244A041.txt,U
Improvements were noted for Bechtel's use of the CAP but the licensee has continued to monitor and ensure the Point Beach CAP standards were met.,43,2030,2175,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Another NOS surveillance, PDN 11-04, was scheduled to assess the effectiveness of the corrective actions.",43,2175,2280,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors noted that causal evaluations, in particular apparent cause evaluations (ACEs), were of good quality.",43,2280,2396,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Although as noted in the following sections, ACEs were found to have a significant reject rate by the corrective action review board (CARB), which was considered a contributing factor in achieving the quality noted.",43,2396,2611,ML11244A041.txt,U
There were instances found where issues were not put into the CAP because the issue had already been identified and entered.,43,2611,2735,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors noted, however, that the plant conditions had been modified significantly due to the EPU, and that issues previously identified (and prioritized or resolved) may now have different conditions warranting a new entry into the CAP.",43,2735,2978,ML11244A041.txt,U
For instance: A clogged drain in the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump room resulted in water spilling on the floor and was previously entered into the CAP.,43,2978,3140,ML11244A041.txt,U
"As a result of EPU, a new electrical panel was installed above the drain.",43,3140,3213,ML11244A041.txt,U
"During a system walkdown with a licensee individual, the drain was found clogged and the inspectors noted the individual had not planned to enter the issue into the CAP 3 Enclosure",43,3213,3393,ML11244A041.txt,T
"since it had been previously entered, even though newly installed equipment may have affected the corrective actions or priority of the initial issue.",45,0,151,ML11244A041.txt,U
This issue was captured in the CAP as Action Request (AR) 01670042.,45,151,218,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspection also revealed a weakness in identifying trends in human performance and equipment issues.,45,218,322,ML11244A041.txt,"H, O"
"Procedure PI-AA-207, ""Trend Coding and Analysis,"" was used for human performance trends and defined a potential trend as a change in frequency of occurrence of a given parameter or a change in the level of performance of a particular group, process, program, or procedure.",45,322,594,ML11244A041.txt,"O, H"
"It also defined an adverse trend as a negative change in performance that knowledge, experience, and judgment indicated an adverse impact on safety or reliability, or because a relative large number of performance problems pointed to more significant future problems.",45,594,861,ML11244A041.txt,"O, H"
"The team identified that from January through June 2011, there was a negative trend regarding ACE rejection rate that was not identified by the licensee.",45,861,1014,ML11244A041.txt,O
This issue was captured in the CAP as AR 01670053.,45,1014,1064,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Additionally, procedure ER-AA-201-2001, ""System and Program Health Reporting,"" was used to identify equipment trends and stated that ""system health reporting is the sum of activities that enables the early identification of system or equipment failures and to determine actions required to ensure reliable equipment performance and the process shall monitor indirect measure and trends of system and component performance of critical equipment.""",45,1064,1509,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Through the inspectors' interviews with staff, it was identified that upon the implementation of the system health reporting system nearly two years ago, certain systems were identified and given a higher priority to establish the direct system reporting system.",45,1509,1771,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors identified the following two examples of equipment trends that were not captured by the licensee's trending program.,45,1771,1902,ML11244A041.txt,U
One of the systems that had direct system monitoring was the service water (SW) system.,45,1902,1989,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors reviewed condition reports for the past 2 years and found 12 condition reports documenting the repetitive position indication and isolation issues for the SW North Header to South Header Crossconnect Valve, SW-2890.",45,1989,2219,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors reviewed the system health reports for SW and found that two trends were identified for pump operating life and increasing vibrations and for increasing numbers of mussels found in the system.,45,2219,2426,ML11244A041.txt,U
"However, the inspectors found no trend identified relative to the SW isolation valve issues.",45,2426,2518,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Based on the above described definitions, the inspectors observed that the repetitive issue met the definition of a trend.",45,2518,2640,ML11244A041.txt,U
"In response, the licensee initiated AR 1670071.",45,2640,2687,ML11244A041.txt,U
One system that utilized indirect system monitoring was the radiation monitoring system.,45,2687,2775,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors reviewed condition reports for the past 2 years (60 conditions reports) related to radiation monitoring equipment issues.,45,2775,2911,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors noted that a number of these conditions reports had been written for the clogging of flow indicators by lake grass and unknown mystery alarms which led to increasing out-of-service times for the equipment.,45,2911,3131,ML11244A041.txt,U
Many of the ARs were closed to action taken without looking into the underlying cause that inspectors concluded represented a trend.,45,3131,3263,ML11244A041.txt,U
"In response, the licensee initiated AR 1670071 to evaluate the observation.",45,3263,3338,ML11244A041.txt,U

Effectiveness of Prioritization and Evaluation of Issues The inspectors found that issue resolutions established and monitored through the IST and the MRC were correctly assigned significance and priority in accordance with station procedures.,53,0,243,ML11244A041.txt,U
"However, vulnerabilities were identified in the licensee's prioritization of conditions, the licensee's evaluation of operability, and the licensee's implementation of interim barriers.",53,243,428,ML11244A041.txt,O
Modifications completed for the EPU resulted in many safety systems changing their risk profiles.,53,428,525,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Most notable, the addition of new auxiliary feedwater pumps (AFW) significantly reduced the risk ranking of the AFW system and components.",53,525,663,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Conversely, the standby gas turbine electrical, G-05, was now the most risk significant component in the plant's probabilistic risk assessment (PRA).",53,663,812,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Therefore, the inspectors noted that open corrective actions from previous issues with these and other systems and components whose risk changed, should be evaluated for changes to priority and completion dates.",53,812,1023,ML11244A041.txt,U
The licensee entered this issue into the CAP as CR01668982 and took action prior to the inspection exit.,53,1023,1127,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The licensee determined that the risk rankings for several systems increased (such as CCW, the chemical and volume control, safety injection, residual heat removal, and emergency diesel generator ventilation) and several decreased (125-Volt direct current and AFW).",53,1127,1392,ML11244A041.txt,U
"For systems that increased, there were 44 open actions, of which 36 required ranking revisions.",53,1392,1487,ML11244A041.txt,U
"For systems that decreased, there were 35 open actions, of which 23 required ranking revisions.",53,1487,1582,ML11244A041.txt,U
All ranking changes were made and the owners of the action items were notified to adjust the current priority and due dates if needed.,53,1582,1716,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors also identified a number of deficiencies with operability and reportability determinations.,53,1716,1822,ML11244A041.txt,U
Integrated inspection report 2011003 included an NCV for a failure to perform an operability determination in accordance with a procedure when a leak on the secondary side of the steam generator was identified in late 2010.,53,1822,2045,ML11244A041.txt,O
The inspectors found a number of examples where operability determinations did not address the degraded or non-conforming condition described in the AR when concluding operability.,53,2045,2225,ML11244A041.txt,O
"Some of these examples included: · AR 01653799 ­ Pitting and Corrosion on SW piping between SW-833 and SW-364 ­ The operability section stated that ""EH [Electro-Hydraulic] system is not in service but this issue needs resolution prior to relying upon EH system.""",53,2225,2487,ML11244A041.txt,U
The operability section did not address the pitting and corrosion of SW piping.,53,2487,2566,ML11244A041.txt,O

"Also, the source of the water was not addressed.",61,709,757,ML11244A041.txt,P
·,63,0,1,ML11244A041.txt,U
These issues were entered into the CAP as AR 01666221 and the operability bases were revised for each condition noted by the NRC.,65,0,129,ML11244A041.txt,U
"With the new information added and all deficient aspects addressed in the operability determination, the inspectors agreed that in all the cases the equipment remained operable.",65,129,306,ML11244A041.txt,U
The conduct of reportability evaluations was also found to be weak.,65,306,373,ML11244A041.txt,O
"In one case, water seals were missing on the electrical conduit entering the electrical panel for the G-1 and G-02 emergency diesel generators.",65,373,516,ML11244A041.txt,O
The basis of the technical assessment for reportability (TAR) contradicted the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR).,65,516,631,ML11244A041.txt,"O, T"
"The FSAR credited the seals for flood protection, while the engineering walkdown for the TAR concluded the flooding scenario discussed in the FSAR would not occur.",65,631,794,ML11244A041.txt,O
"Based on the inspectors' questions, the TAR was revised to delete the contradiction with the FSAR.",65,794,892,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors also noted that in some instances reportability evaluations were not conducted until the NRC raised questions.,65,892,1017,ML11244A041.txt,O
One issue involved a non-seismic block wall that could fall on and rupture the nearby condensate storage tanks with a potential to for flooding safety-related components.,65,1017,1187,ML11244A041.txt,U
Another issue described non-seismic water storage tanks in the auxiliary building that could fail during a seismic event causing flooding of the residual heat removal pumps.,65,1187,1360,ML11244A041.txt,U
Several of these reportability evaluations were still being evaluated by the NRC.,65,1360,1441,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors noted that similar observations had been made by the resident staff.,65,1441,1524,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Inspection Report (IR) 2011003 issued August 5, 2011, discussed an NCV associated with the failure to perform an immediate operability assessment for a Unit 1 secondary side leak in containment.",65,1524,1718,ML11244A041.txt,O
The inspectors also noted that Nuclear Oversight had identified four instances where operability determinations were not prompt or initial determinations did not invoke more timely and rigorous documentation of the conditions and concluded that the quality of some of the operability notes could be improved and that training was being performed to address the issue.,65,1718,2085,ML11244A041.txt,O
These observations were documented in AR 01652090.,65,2085,2135,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors reviewed the licensee's CAP and noted weaknesses in implementation of interim barriers.,65,2135,2237,ML11244A041.txt,O
"Procedure PI-AA-204 was reviewed and the inspectors found that it defined ""an interim corrective action as an action taken to temporarily prevent the effects of a condition or make an event less likely to recur during the period when the condition is being evaluated and until final corrective actions are completed.""",65,2237,2554,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Also, the inspectors noted that procedure PI-AA-205 further clarified that ""compensatory/interim actions are classified as interim actions designed to arrest or minimize recurrence until the corrective action to prevent recurrence or corrective action has been implemented.""",65,2554,2828,ML11244A041.txt,U
6 Enclosure,65,2828,2839,ML11244A041.txt,U
"However, neither of these procedures discussed when and who should evaluate and implement interim or compensatory corrective actions and hence they may not be done.",67,0,165,ML11244A041.txt,U
The most significant example of where better interim actions could have precluded a more significant issue is described below.,67,165,291,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors found an issue concerning inappropriate breaching of HELB doors during plant modifications that was entered into the CAP in February 2010.,67,291,444,ML11244A041.txt,O
Several interim corrective actions were established for the Operations department while the causal evaluation was conducted.,67,444,568,ML11244A041.txt,U
"In June 2010, the NRC identified that the control room door, a HELB barrier, was blocked open by maintenance, a violation of HELB requirements.",67,568,711,ML11244A041.txt,T
This occurrence resulted in a licensee event report (LER) and several NCVs.,67,711,786,ML11244A041.txt,O
More widespread interim corrective actions could have prevented the control room door issue.,67,786,878,ML11244A041.txt,U
(3) Effectiveness of Corrective Actions The inspectors concluded that the corrective action program was generally effective in addressing identified issues.,67,878,1034,ML11244A041.txt,U
A licensee emphasis on corrective action due dates has resulted in no overdue CAP actions for over 550 days.,67,1034,1142,ML11244A041.txt,U
Corrective actions were generally appropriate for the identified issues.,67,1142,1214,ML11244A041.txt,U
One exception is discussed below.,67,1214,1247,ML11244A041.txt,U
"AR 01661717, Incorrect Noun Name on Instrument Face, was initiated on June 17, 2011, by Operations.",67,1247,1346,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The AR discusses ""old"" AFW pump instrumentation on the C01 main control room board still labeled AFW instead of its new system description as the ""Standby Steam Generator Pumps.""",67,1346,1524,ML11244A041.txt,O
The AR actions did not try to determine why the labels were not corrected as part of the recent modification or determine the extent of condition.,67,1524,1670,ML11244A041.txt,O
"Instead, it assigned actions to fix the labels with a due data in October.",67,1670,1744,ML11244A041.txt,U
"As a result of inspectors' questions, AR 01668861 was initiated to perform a causal analysis and extent of condition.",67,1744,1861,ML11244A041.txt,U
"Through subsequent discussions with the modification engineer, the inspectors determined the labels had not been corrected yet since the modification was partially accepted and modification activities were still in progress to correct the labels.",67,1861,2107,ML11244A041.txt,U
"In effect, the issues in the CAP could have been addressed with no actions required by reference to the modification.",67,2107,2224,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors noted that the licensee has self-identified many instances where corrective actions were closed inappropriately.,67,2224,2351,ML11244A041.txt,O
"The inspectors verified that plant staff do get feedback, or feedback was available to them, on how their issues were addressed.",67,2351,2479,ML11244A041.txt,U
"However, the area that most personnel interviewed would like to see more improvement was to have more input for their issues that were dispositioned as closed to actions taken to ensure the issue was properly understood and addressed.",67,2479,2713,ML11244A041.txt,O
For instance: A licensee individual initiated AR 01654217 when the small article monitor (SAM) was found out-of-service due to high background.,67,2713,2856,ML11244A041.txt,O
"Subsequent investigation found that some high activity smears were thrown in the nearby trash, causing the high background.",67,2856,2979,ML11244A041.txt,T
"Further, the smears were there because they had been used in the iSOLO instrument, which was considered by the individual inappropriate for this high level of activity.",67,2979,3147,ML11244A041.txt,O
The corrective action desired was to 7 Enclosure,67,3147,3195,ML11244A041.txt,U
prevent radiation protection (RP) personnel from using the iSOLO for that high contamination level.,69,0,100,ML11244A041.txt,U
The AR was closed to action taken which was to remove the swipes from the trash and returning the SAM to service.,69,100,213,ML11244A041.txt,U
The AR initiator was not consulted or satisfied with this closure.,69,213,279,ML11244A041.txt,O
"The inspectors found that additional actions were completed but not documented in the AR, including discussions with RP personnel on use of the iSOLO and putting new equipment in service to use for the high contamination smears.",69,279,507,ML11244A041.txt,"O, T"
The AR initiator would probably have been satisfied closing the AR to these actions.,69,507,591,ML11244A041.txt,U

"The intent was to determine if the licensee was effectively integrating OE experience into the performance of daily activities, whether evaluations of issues were proper and conducted by qualified personnel, whether the licensee's program was sufficient to prevent future occurrences of previous industry events, and whether the licensee effectively used the information in developing departmental assessments and facility audits.",69,969,1399,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors also assessed if corrective actions, as a result of OE experience, were identified and implemented effectively and in a timely manner.",69,1399,1548,ML11244A041.txt,U

"Assessment In general, OE was effectively used at the station.",69,1550,1612,ML11244A041.txt,U
The inspectors observed that OE was discussed as part of the daily station and pre-job briefings.,69,1612,1709,ML11244A041.txt,U
Industry OE was effectively disseminated across the various plant departments and no issues were identified during the inspectors' review of licensee OE evaluations.,69,1709,1874,ML11244A041.txt,U
"However, during the review of corrective actions associated with an NCV, the following instance was found where operating experience was not incorporated into site guidance and, if it had been, the event may have been prevented.",69,1874,2102,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The inspectors reviewed the corrective actions related to NCV 2010005-03, ""Failure to Submit LER related to breach of HELB Barrier,"" including the licensee's root cause evaluation (RCE) 01616620, ""4Q10 Potential NCV on Failure to Submit LER on HELB Issues.""",69,2102,2359,ML11244A041.txt,U
"The licensee's RCE concluded that the root cause was inadequate evaluation of NRC RIS 2001-009, ""Control of Hazard Barriers.""",69,2359,2484,ML11244A041.txt,"O, T"
"The inspectors noted that even though the initial event occurred in 2001, the licensee's evaluation limited the scope of revalidation to 10 regulatory information summaries, all from 2010.",69,2484,2672,ML11244A041.txt,O
